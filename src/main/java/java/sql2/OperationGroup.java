/**
 * A set of {@link Operation}s that share certain properties, are managed as a
 * unit, and are executed as a unit. The {@link Operation}s created by an
 * {@link OperationGroup} and submitted are the member {@link Operation}s of
 * that {@link OperationGroup}.
 *
 * An {@link OperationGroup} conceptually has a collection of member
 * {@link Operation}s. When an {@link OperationGroup} is submitted it is placed
 * in the collection of the {@link OperationGroup} of which it is a member. The
 * member {@link OperationGroup} is executed according to the attributes of the
 * {@link OperationGroup} of which it is a member. The member {@link Operation}s
 * of an {@link OperationGroup} are executed according to the attributes of that
 * {@link OperationGroup}.
 *
 * How an {@link OperationGroup} is executed depends on its attributes.
 *
 * If an {@link OperationGroup} has a condition and the value of that condition
 * is {@link Boolean#TRUE} then execute the member {@link Operation}s as below.
 * If it is {@link Boolean#FALSE} then the {@link OperationGroup} is completed
 * with the value null. If the condition completed exceptionally then the
 * {@link OperationGroup} is completed exceptionally with
 * {@link SqlSkippedException} that has that exception as its cause.
 *
 * If the {@link OperationGroup} is sequential the member {@link Operation}s are
 * executed in the order they were submitted. If it is parallel, they may be
 * executed in any order including simultaneously.
 *
 * If an {@link OperationGroup} is dependent and a member {@link Operation}
 * completes exceptionally the remaining member {@link Operation}s in the
 * collection are completed exceptionally with a {@link SqlSkippedException}
 * that has the initial {@link Exception} as its cause. A member
 * {@link Operation} in-flight may either complete normally or be completed
 * exceptionally but must complete one way or the other. [NOTE: Too strong?]
 *
 * If an {@link OperationGroup} is held additional member {@link Operation}s may
 * be submitted after the {@link OperationGroup} is submitted. If an
 * {@link OperationGroup} is not held, no additional member {@link Operation}s
 * may be submitted after the {@link OperationGroup} is submitted. If an
 * {@link OperationGroup} is held it will be completed only after it is released
 * or if conditional and the condition is not {@link Boolean#TRUE}. If a
 * {@link OperationGroup} is dependent, held, one of its member
 * {@link Operation}s completed exceptionally, and its queue is empty then the
 * {@link OperationGroup} is released.
 *
 * ISSUE: Currently no way to create a nested {@link OperationGroup}. That is a
 * limitation but may be a simplification we can live with. Or not.
 *
 * @param <S> The type of the result of the member {@link Operation}s
 * @param <T> The type of the result of aggregating the member
