/**
 * Represents the database transaction open when the next submitted commit or
 * rollback {@link Operation} is executed.
 *
 * As this API is asynchronous, the transaction active in the database at the
 * moment an {@link Operation} is created or submitted is likely to be unrelated
 * to that {@link Operation}. This type is an abstraction of the (possibly)
 * future database transaction that a currently created and submitted
 * {@link Operation} belongs to. This enables an error handler or result
 * processor to influence the currently active transaction. If such a processor
 * were to submit a commit or rollback {@link Operation} the active transaction
 * when the commit or rollback is executed might be unrelated to the
 * {@link Operation} that caused it to be submitted.
 *
 * While there might be exceptions, in general an error handler or result
 * processor should never submit a commit or rollback {@link Operation}. Instead
 * a commit {@link Operation} should be submitted in sequence with the
 * {@link Operation} containing the error handler. The error handler should have
 * access to a {@link Transaction} retrieved when its {@link Operation} is
 * submitted. If the error handler should cause a rollback instead of a commit
 * the error handler should call {@link setRollbackOnly} on that
 * {@link Transaction}.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 *   Transaction t = conn.getTransaction();
 *   conn.countOperation(updateSql)
 *       .resultProcessor( count -> { if (count > 1) t.setRollbackOnly(); } )
 *       .submit();
 *   conn.commit();
 * }</pre>
 *
 * When the result processor is executed it is quite likely that a close
 * {@link Operation} has already been submitted. If instead of executing
 * {@code t.setRollbackOnly()} the result processor instead submitted a rollback
 * {@link Operation} that would likely fail since the {@link Connection} quite
 * likely already had a queued close {@link Operation}.
 *
 * Similarly if the result processor executed
 * {@code conn.getTransaction().setRollbackOnly()} that would quite likely fail
 * as database transaction referenced by the returned {@link Transaction} is the
 * transaction active when the next next commit or rollback {@link Operation} is
 * submitted. Since the {@link Connection} might already be closed there would
 * be no subsequent commit or rollback {@link Operation}.
 *
 * NOTE: The {@link Connection#commit} and {@link Connection#rollback} methods
 * are on {@link Connection}, not {@link Transaction}. These methods queue an
 * {@link Operation} to end the transaction current at the time these
 * {@link Operation}s are executed. As such they are actions on the
 * {@link Connection} not the {@link Transaction}.
