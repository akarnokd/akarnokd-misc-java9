 * A multi-operation is an {@link Operation} that returns one or more results in
 * addition to the result defined by the {@link Operation}. A {@link DynamicMultiOperation} is a
 * multi-operation where the number and types of the results are determined at
 * execution.
 * 
 * NOTE: In general one way to do things is sufficient however the API provides
 * two ways to handle multiple results. This way, the dynamic way, is required
 * because the number and type of results cannot always be known in advance. The
 * static way is also provided because it is much easier to use when the number
 * and type of results is known. The improvement in ease of use outweighs the
 * duplication IMO. If necessary one or the other can be eliminated. Eliminating
 * dynamic reduces functionality. Eliminating static reduces ease of use in what
 * I believe to be a common case.
